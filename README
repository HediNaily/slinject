Copyright (C) 2011 Andrei Kashcha (anvaka@gmail.com)

Usage: slinject [--mode [Args | Auto | Enum]] [-p Pid]
Options:
  -m, --mode=VALUE           Injection mode:
                               Enum - find all running Silverlight apps and
                               suggest one to choose;
                               Args - process Id should be specified by -p
                               parameter;
                               Auto - inject to the first found Silverlight
                               application;
  -p, --pid=VALUE            Target Siliverlight process identifier
  -i, --install              Installs injector. Should be called only once and
                               requires elevated trust. Can't be called with
                               other options.
  -u, --uninstall            Revert changes made by --install operation. Doing
                               this disables further assembly injection
                               attempts.
Note: If you are running slinject for the first time make sure to install it
by calling 'slinject --install'
